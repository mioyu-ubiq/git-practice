This is the second Test file for git pratice: 
The quick brown jumped over the lazy dog

Waltz, bad nymph, for quick jigs vex
Quick zephyrs blow, vexing daft Jim
Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow
Two driven jocks help fax my big quiz
Five quacking zephyrs jolt my wax bed
The five boxing wizards jump quickly
Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs
